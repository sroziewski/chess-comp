## Key Assumptions for Tag Prediction
1. **Position Information is Available**: The most fundamental assumption is that your dataset contains information about the chess position for each puzzle, such as:
    - FEN notation
    - Initial moves that led to the puzzle position
    - Material balance and piece placement

2. **Correlation Between Position and Opening**: The prediction methods assume there's a meaningful correlation between the chess position characteristics and the opening it originated from. For example:
    - Certain pawn structures are typical of specific openings
    - Piece development patterns are often opening-specific
    - Material balances may correlate with opening families

3. **Consistency in Opening Tags**: The existing tags (for 21.52% of puzzles) are assumed to be correctly applied and consistent, providing a reliable training basis.


# ## Concrete Data Requirements
# For these prediction methods to work, your dataset would need to include some of these features:

# 1. FEN notation of the puzzle position
# 2. Initial moves that led to the position (PGN or move list)
# 3. Piece counts and placement features
# 4. Pawn structure information

# Assuming df contains these columns:
# - 'FEN': The position in FEN notation
# - 'OpeningTags': The opening tags (missing for 78.48% of puzzles)
# - 'piece_counts_white_pawns', 'piece_counts_black_knights', etc.
# - 'central_control', 'kingside_pawns', etc.

# 1. Extract position features
position_features = [
    'piece_counts_white_pawns', 'piece_counts_white_knights', 'piece_counts_white_bishops',
    'piece_counts_white_rooks', 'piece_counts_white_queens',
    'piece_counts_black_pawns', 'piece_counts_black_knights', 'piece_counts_black_bishops',
    'piece_counts_black_rooks', 'piece_counts_black_queens',
    'central_control', 'kingside_pawns', 'queenside_pawns',
    'pawn_structure_isolated', 'pawn_structure_doubled'
]

# 2. Build a model using puzzles WITH tags
has_tags = ~df['OpeningTags'].isna() & (df['OpeningTags'] != '')
X_train = df[has_tags][position_features]
y_train = df[has_tags]['OpeningTags'].apply(lambda x: x.split()[0] if x else "Unknown")

# 3. Train a classifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 4. Predict for puzzles WITHOUT tags
missing_tags = ~has_tags
X_predict = df[missing_tags][position_features]
predicted_tags = model.predict(X_predict)
prediction_confidence = np.max(model.predict_proba(X_predict), axis=1)

## If Position Features Are Not Available
If your dataset doesn't have position-related features, these prediction methods wouldn't work effectively. In that case, you'd need to:
1. **Generate position features** from FEN or PGN data if available
2. **Use external engines** to analyze positions and extract features
3. **Fall back to simpler approaches** like:
    - Only using the puzzles with tags (21.52%)
    - Creating a separate model for puzzles without tags
    - Using other non-opening features to compensate
